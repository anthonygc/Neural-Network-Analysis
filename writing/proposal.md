##### Proposal Title :

```
Neural Network
```

For this project, I would like to create an artificial neural network in R. I would like to not only implement a network but also explain what it is and give a detailed explanation of how it can be used. My motivation for doing this is due to my fascination of how we can replicate a model of the brain. I am fascinated in how we are able to get computers to solve problems that only humans can due our unique cognitive abilities. My goal this week is to figure out what use case I will use neural network for.
